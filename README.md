# Soul Connection Dashboard

## 1. Project Overview

The project aims to develop a frontend and backend for **Soul Connection**, a coaching agency specializing in relationships. The goal is to migrate existing data from the old system to a new dashboard, providing full data management capabilities for both clients and coaches.

### Customer requests:
- **Account Management (Feature A)**: Allows the creation of employee accounts and assignment of clients. Each coach can only see their assigned clients, while managers can view all data, ensuring GDPR compliance.
- **Client Profile (Feature B)**: Displays client information such as name, address, phone number, past meetings (including details like date, rating, and method of meeting), and payment history (accessible only by managers).
- **Statistics (Feature C)**: Provides graphs that allow managers to compare coach performance based on the number of meetings their clients have.
- **Coaching Advice (Feature D)**: A collection of tips to help coaches manage various types of client profiles.
- **Events (Feature E)**: Shows a schedule of events organized by the agency (parties, workshops, speed dating) with a map of the event location and the number of registered clients.
- **Astrological Compatibility (Feature F)**: Allows coaches to analyze the astrological compatibility between two clients based on their zodiac signs.
- **Clothing Style (Feature G)**: Displays photos of clients' clothing and allows coaches to test different clothing combinations to advise clients on their style.

The site is **responsive**, accessible on all devices, and ensures a seamless transition between the existing systemâ€™s data and the new interface.

## 2. API Usage

The **Soul Connection API** is critical for managing data in this project. It facilitates employee authentication and access to client information.

### How to Use the API:
- **Authentication**: 
  1. Use a group token in the `X-Group-Authorization` header for every HTTP request.
  2. Once authenticated, employees need to log in using the `/employees/login` route with their email and password.
  3. After logging in, an access token (Bearer token) is provided, which must be used to authorize requests to other routes.
  
- **Required Headers** for most API calls:
  - `X-Group-Authorization: XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX`
  - `Authorization: Bearer XXXXXXXXXXX`
